### Advanced Features## Operation Modes

- **üîê Admin Approval System** - Complete request moderation with interactive controls

- **üë• Multi-user Support** - Flexible operation modes for different scenariosThe bot supports three operation modes, configurable by the admin via `/settings`, catering to different use cases:

- **üîí Security First** - Optional password protection and role-based access

- **üè¢ Group Mode** - Collaborative media management for teams and families- **Normal Mode**:

- **üåç Multi-language** - Respects Overseerr language settings

  - Users log in with their individual Overseerr credentials (email and password).

> [!Note]  - Requests and issue reports are tied to each user‚Äôs Overseerr account, ensuring personalized tracking.

> Media titles and descriptions match your Overseerr language settings, while the bot interface remains in English.  - Ideal for users with their own Overseerr accounts who want full control over their requests and notifications.



![1 Start](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55cc4796-7a4f-4909-a260-0395e7fb202a)- **API Mode**:



---  - Users select an existing Overseerr user from a list without needing credentials, using the Overseerr API key for requests.

  - Simplifies access for users without Overseerr accounts, with requests automatically approved by Overseerr.

## üöÄ Quick Start  - Issue reports are attributed to the admin‚Äôs account due to API key usage.

  - Best for environments where quick access is prioritized over individual account management.

### Docker (Recommended)

- **Shared Mode**:

```bash

# Pull and run with Docker  - All users share a single Overseerr account configured by the admin, streamlining group usage.

docker run -d \  - The admin logs in once, and all requests and issue reports use this shared account.

  --name overseerr-telegram-bot \  - Perfect for small groups (e.g., families or friends) sharing a media server, with notifications sent to a common Telegram chat.

  -e TELEGRAM_TOKEN="your_bot_token" \

  -e OVERSEERR_API_URL="http://your-overseerr:5055/api/v1" \Learn more about configuring modes in the [Wiki](https://github.com/LetsGoDude/OverseerrRequestViaTelegramBot/wiki#operation-modes).

  -e OVERSEERR_API_KEY="your_api_key" \

- Audio issues (e.g., out-of-sync, missing tracks)

---- Subtitle issues (e.g., incorrect timing, missing files)

- Other playback problems

## üêõ Issue Reporting

Reports are submitted to Overseerr, with attribution based on the operation mode (individual user in Normal Mode, admin in API Mode, shared account in Shared Mode).

Report media problems directly from search results:
- **Video Issues**: Pixelation, buffering, quality problems.

![4 Check - Status der anforderung und problem melden](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4dd828ed-df99-4861-bff9-b40c758c0b24)

- **Audio Issues**: Sync problems, missing tracks, quality issues

![7 Problem](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cb1322e-4b32-4b44-8873-65f6a9e6b471)

- **Subtitle Issues** - Timing problems, missing files, encoding issues

- **General Playback** - Any other streaming or playback problems---



![4 Check - Status der anforderung und problem melden](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4dd828ed-df99-4861-bff9-b40c758c0b24)## Group Mode
![7 Problem](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8cb1322e-4b32-4b44-8873-65f6a9e6b471)

Group Mode enhances collaborative usage by restricting bot interactions to a designated Telegram group or thread:

---

- **Enable Group Mode**: Only the admin can activate this via `/settings`, storing the setting in `data/bot_config.json`.

## üë• Group Mode- **Set Primary Chat**: Running `/start` in a group or thread sets it as the primary chat, identified by `primary_chat_id`.

- **Usage**: When active, all commands (`/start`, `/check`) and notifications are confined to the primary chat/thread, ignoring other chats. This ensures a unified experience for group members.

Perfect for collaborative media management:- **Example**: In a family Telegram group, users request "Toy Story" via `/check`, and the bot responds only in that group, with notifications (e.g., ‚ÄúToy Story is available‚Äù) sent to all members.

- **Centralized Communication** - All interactions in designated group/thread- **Use Case**: Ideal for shared media servers (e.g., Plex) where a group collaborates on requests, keeping communication centralized.

- **Shared Requests** - Team members collaborate on media requests

- **Unified Notifications** - Everyone stays informed about media availabilityFor setup details, visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/LetsGoDude/OverseerrRequestViaTelegramBot/wiki#group-mode).

- **Access Control** - Admin controls who can participate

---

**Setup**: Enable via admin `/settings`, then run `/start` in your target group.

## FAQ and Troubleshooting

---

- **How do I set up the bot for the first time?**\

## üìÅ Project Structure  Follow the installation guides in the [Wiki](https://github.com/LetsGoDude/OverseerrRequestViaTelegramBot/wiki) for Ubuntu or Docker.



| Folder | Purpose |- **What if I forget the bot password?**\

|--------|---------|  The password is set via the `PASSWORD` environment variable or `config.py`. Admins can reset it by updating the configuration. See the [Wiki](https://github.com/LetsGoDude/OverseerrRequestViaTelegramBot/wiki) for details.

| `api/` | Overseerr API integration and request management |

| `handlers/` | Telegram command and callback handlers |- **Why can‚Äôt I request 4K titles?**  

| `notifications/` | Webhook system and notification management |  4K requests depend on Overseerr permissions:

| `config/` | Configuration management and constants |  - Normal Mode: Tied to the user‚Äôs account permissions.

| `session/` | User session and authentication handling |  - API Mode: Tied to the selected user‚Äôs permissions.

| `docker/` | Docker deployment files and configurations |  - Shared Mode: Tied to the shared account‚Äôs permissions.  

| `docs/` | Comprehensive project documentation |  Check Overseerr settings or contact your admin.

| `tests/` | Automated testing suite |

| `utils/` | Utility functions and error handling |- **Why don‚Äôt I see the ‚ÄúManage Notifications‚Äù option in /settings?**  

  The ‚ÄúManage Notifications‚Äù button appears only after selecting an Overseerr user (via login in Normal Mode, user selection in API Mode, or admin login in Shared Mode). Use `/settings` to log in or select a user first.

- **How do I troubleshoot bot errors?**
